- Consider cultural differences in communication styles

### 3. **Emotional Intelligence**
- Acknowledge emotions without being prescriptive
- Provide validation while encouraging growth
- Balance support with accountability

### 4. **Consistency**
- Maintain consistent tone across all touchpoints
- Use the same terminology throughout the platform
- Ensure error messages follow the same empathetic approach

## Testing & Validation

1. **Error Message Tone**: Test empathetic vs. neutral error messages
2. **AI Response Style**: Compare formal vs. conversational AI responses
3. **Safety Message Approach**: Test direct vs. supportive safety messaging

### User Feedback Collection

2. **Emotional Impact**: "How did this message make you feel?"
3. **Actionability**: "Did you know what to do next?"
